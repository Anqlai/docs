# Core Concepts of GAT

GAT (Generative AI Tool) is built on several key concepts that work together to provide a seamless, intelligent data integration and analysis experience. Understanding these concepts will help you maximize the value you get from GAT.

## Data Sources and Integration

<Tip>
GAT connects to over 200 data sources, bringing all your business data into one unified system.
</Tip>

Data integration is the foundation of GAT's functionality. It allows you to:

- Connect multiple data sources (e.g., CRM, ERP, marketing tools)
- Automatically sync data in real-time or on a schedule
- Create a single source of truth for your business data

## Natural Language Queries

At the heart of GAT is its ability to understand and process natural language queries.

<Note>
You can ask GAT questions in plain English, just as you would ask a human analyst.
</Note>

Examples of queries you can ask:
- "What was our revenue growth last quarter compared to the same period last year?"
- "Show me the top 10 customers by lifetime value"
- "What's the average time to close a deal in the healthcare sector?"

GAT's natural language processing (NLP) engine interprets your question, identifies relevant data sources, and formulates the appropriate data queries.

## AI-Powered Responses

GAT doesn't just retrieve data; it generates intelligent, context-aware responses.
