## Asking Questions

GAT's natural language processing allows you to ask questions just as you would to a human analyst.

### Best Practices for Queries

1. Be specific: "What was our revenue in Q2 2023?" is better than "How much money did we make?"
2. Provide context: Mention specific time periods, departments, or products when relevant.
3. Use follow-up questions: GAT remembers the context of your conversation.

<CodeGroup>
  ```plain Example Queries
  What were our top 5 selling products last month?
  Compare customer acquisition cost between our email and social media campaigns.
  Show me the trend of employee satisfaction scores over the past year.
  Which customers are at risk of churning based on their recent activity?
  ```
</CodeGroup>
